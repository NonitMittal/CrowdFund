# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile     # compile the contract
npm run deploy          # deploy the contract
```

To verify smart contract on-chain

```shell
# currently only for mumbai testnet
npm run verify <deployed_contract_address>
```
